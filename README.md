# Breaking the Monolith by using hapi 
## Background
Let me get the disclaimer out of the way: I am not an expert on Hapi
I started looking into Hapi's ability to break components out.
This is my attempt to follow other tutorials from a hello world to a true component system.
I have broken this down into the following steps

#HAPI Tutorial - Monolith - 6 - customer
This step moves from using npm as the build tool to yarn.
I am moving away from using npm because it does not lock the dependencies.
So a build two days apart could get different set of dependencies.

* Installing yarn
    * to install you can run the following command ```npm install yarn -g```
        You can also find detail on installs here (https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/)
* Use yarn
    Use yarn in the same way you use npm.  Just replace npm with the work yarn.
    * So the initial build of a project would be ```yarn install```
        This will create the following output
        ```
        yarn install v0.24.4
        info No lockfile found.
        warning customers@1.0.0: No license field
